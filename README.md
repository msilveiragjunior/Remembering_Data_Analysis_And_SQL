Every years I remember the foundations of python by doing basic exercises and solving basic problems. In the last repo I covered the book Python Crash Course, from Eric Matthes (Novatec). This time I'll try to cover most of the book SQL for Data Analysis, from Cathy Tanimura (O'Reilly). Copyright 2021 Cathy Tanimura, 978-1-492-08878-3; but applied to python. So I'll not cover from the book from cover to cover with it's codes and so on, but I'll try to follow it and apply their examples to new codes. I'll also try to cover
most of the SQL base of coding. With examples applied to python and sqlite3.
Also, following Cathy Tanimura's code examples, I'll try to explain concepts for my own understanding.
I found that to be the best way to remember the basics and write, in a concise way, the content inside it.
All I'm doing is synthesizing the logic of the examples and explanations of the book for personal purposes - i.e. remembering the knowledge from it and trying to be useful,
by giving people a more concise way of understanding concepts; or at least trying. If something is wrong, please, contact me.
We'll use sqllite3 to create and manipulate the databases inside this repo. But similarities with postgresql and other types of SQL are immense.
So you can also use the examples, but I'll try to manipulate the databases using only python and not an external software.
