# 🐍 Python + SQL — Integrated Learning Project

> **Bridging Python programming and SQL for Data Analysis**  
> A personal synthesis project combining structured learning, coding practice, and clear documentation.

## 📘 Overview

Every year, I revisit the **foundations of Python** through small, focused projects.  
In my last repository, I explored _**Python Crash Course**_ by **Eric Matthes** (Novatec),  
summarizing its key lessons with concise and functional code examples.

This new project builds upon that habit — inspired by  
_**SQL for Data Analysis**_ by **Cathy Tanimura**  
(O’Reilly, 2021 — ISBN `978-1-492-08878-3`).

> 🧠 The goal: apply the book’s SQL concepts directly in **Python**, using `sqlite3`  
> to create, query, and analyze data — all within a single, self-contained environment.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository does **not** reproduce the book’s content verbatim.  
Instead, it follows its conceptual structure while adapting the examples to **Python-based SQL implementations**.

**Objectives:**
- Strengthen understanding of **core SQL principles**  
- Demonstrate the integration of **SQL logic into Python workflows**  
- Create a **concise and practical resource** for learners and professionals  
- Build a **portfolio-ready** demonstration of applied data skills

## 🧩 Learning Approach

To keep the learning focused and incremental, I’ll:

1. Use **`sqlite3`** to create and manipulate relational databases directly from Python.  
2. Translate **SQL examples** from the book into **Pythonic code blocks**.  
3. Explain each concept in **my own words**, reinforcing comprehension through synthesis.  
4. Maintain examples that are **clear, modular, and reproducible**.  

Although this project uses **SQLite**, most syntax applies to  
**PostgreSQL**, **MySQL**, and other relational database systems.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.11+**
- **SQLite3**
- **Pandas** (optional, for analysis)
- **Jupyter / VSCode** (for interactive exploration)

## 🧭 Educational Philosophy

This project represents an **active recall** approach —  
rather than memorizing syntax, I focus on **understanding the reasoning** behind each SQL operation,  
and how it connects to **data manipulation and analysis in Python**.

By translating each example conceptually and technically,  
I aim to **bridge structured query logic** with **programmatic thinking** —  
a skill essential for data engineers and analysts.
